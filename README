An abusive module for UnrealIRCD 3

Sends fake messages from the ircd to fool clients into thinking they've 
joined numerous channels. Doesn't actually do anything server side 
(apart from send the message).

Replace the password define with a password you want (because you don't 
want just anyone using this module!), and compile like normal.
WARNING: It can crash clients, potentially getting you in trouble
